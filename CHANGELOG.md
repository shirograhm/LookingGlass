### 1.6.1
Forgot to push option for Buff Timer size

### 1.6.0
Added Buff Definitions, hover over your buffs to see them. Buff definitions have to be pre-defined, so modded buffs need to utilize BuffDefinitions.RegisterBuff in order for their buffs to show up (this can technically be done one either side if you know the names of buffs, but it's extremely tedius with how many mods are out there). Added a few new items to StatsDisplay (maxComboThisRun, currentCombatKills, maxKillCombo, maxKillComboThisRun). Added font scale options for Item Stats. Currently thinking about a setup where you can create as many StatsDisplay tabs as you want and move them around (such as having one as a dedicated DPS meter if you wanted to), but nothing to show for it yet, look forward to it though!

### 1.5.2
Fixed a few bugs around command. Fixed a description conflict with Manuscript from mystic's items

### 1.5.1
Fixed sorting options for the equipment menus. Changed calculate function for ItemStats to use a CharacterMaster for better calculations in the future

### 1.5.0
Added sorting options to the command menu and scrapper menu. Added equip slot functionality for itemstats.

### 1.4.2
Fixed DPS meter not resetting if you leave while it still has values stored. Fixed transforming into specific mobs like a LesserWisp causing StatsDisplay to break until restart

### 1.4.1
Fixed StatsDisplay not working with RiskUI. Added an option for how many decimal points to be used for floating point values.

### 1.4.0
Fixed a rare bug with CleanHUD. Fixed issue with scrappers and other menu's scaling (as in we don't touch them anymore since it's not needed and makes stuff look wonky and small). Fixed buff timers not showing up all the time. We actually use the setting for item counters now. Probably fixed an issue with Minimap and Refightilization (but it was inconsistent so I'll be on the lookout). Updated StatsDisplay to scale better automatically, also supports manual scaling now (thanks yuukotf2 on github!). Added an option for full item descriptions on pickup (thanks SSM240 on github!). New option to show permanent cooldown numbers for skills too. Added a secondary StatsDisplay string which, when enabled, will be used when the scoreboard is held open.

### 1.3.2
Last update was fake, this one is real a cool, not cringe

### 1.3.1
Fixed issue with buff timers applying to all buffs. Added a few new items to the StatsDisplay syntax. Added an option for StatsDisplay to remove the default color formatting.

### 1.3.0
Added buff timers. Added option to show hidden items. Added permanent equip item timers. Added option for global resizing of StatsDisplay text size

### 1.2.6
I suck at math

### 1.2.5
I forgot but it probably didn't work

### 1.2.4
Fixed luck based calculations. Fixed command windows with controllers (again)

### 1.2.3
Fixed UI padding for the RiskUI section

### 1.2.2
Fixed resized command window behaving poorly with controllers

### 1.2.1
Fixed item sorting when only sorting scrap and nothing else. Added critWithLuck and bleedChanceWithLuck to the stats display stuff, which as stated, factors in your luck

### 1.2.0
Added item stats on ping. Added item counters. Fixed the armor coloring being cIsUtility instead of cIsHealing

### 1.1.0
